data/repositories.json

The data in this file is the foundation of all of the data used and generated by this application.


`npm run capture-node-data`

This command uses the data in the _data/repositories.json_ file to identify dependencies the repositories have to themselves.  It generates the _data/node-all.json_ and _data/node-foundation.json_ files for use by the `npm run cli` command and _lib/dependency-graph/index.js_ script.


`npm run cli`

Running just `npm run cli` will execute the script with default values.  If you wish you to pass options to the script you can do so via `npm run cli -- --option=value` where the options and values can be found by running `npm run cli -- --help`.


_lib/dependency-graph/index.js_

This script is meant to be the possible API interface into the dependency graph data.  These are examples of how can use the code:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const DependencyGraph = require('./dependency-graph')
const graph = new DependencyGraph()

console.log(graph.getAll())
console.log(graph.getDependantsOf('ember-frost-sort'))
console.log(graph.getDependenciesOf('ember-frost-date-picker'))
console.log(graph.getStartingAt('ember-frost-date-picker'))
console.log(graph.hasNode('ember-frost-date-picker'))
```

The `DependencyGraph()` class can be instantiated with a boolean value indicating whether the _data/node-all.json_ or _data/node-foundation.json_ data should be interrogated.
